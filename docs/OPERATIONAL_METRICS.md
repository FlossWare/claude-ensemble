# Operational Metrics REST API

The canonical gateway exposes the append-only operational metrics ledger at
`/api/v1/metrics`. Listing is paginated so the HTTP response and retained page
remain bounded as the ledger grows.

## List metrics

`GET /api/v1/metrics?limit=100&offset=0`

- `limit` defaults to `100` and must be between `1` and `500`.
- `offset` defaults to `0` and must be a non-negative integer.
- Unknown, duplicate, blank, or malformed query parameters return HTTP `400`.
- Records are returned in chronological order, skipping malformed JSONL records.
- `next_offset` is the next offset when another page exists, otherwise `null`.

Example response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "metrics": [],
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0,
  "next_offset": null
}
```

Clients should request the returned `next_offset` until it is `null`. Offset
pagination reflects the ledger as it exists at each request; records appended
between page requests may appear in later pages. Consumers requiring a stable
snapshot should copy/export the ledger or use a separate snapshot mechanism.

## Aggregate metrics

`GET /api/v1/metrics/aggregate` streams the ledger and returns counts by
service, model, and status, total estimated cost, and average latency. The
aggregation does not construct a list of all metric records.

## Write metrics

`POST /api/v1/metrics` accepts one metric record and returns HTTP `201` when
the record is appended. Metrics are operational telemetry, not evidence of
task correctness or learned outcomes.
