# Claude Ensemble

**Complete, production-ready multi-AI orchestration toolkit.**

Claude Ensemble is a portable toolkit for orchestrating multiple AI models and Claude Code workflows. It combines model routing, multi-phase arbitration, autonomous outcome learning, cost tracking, compression, caching, and reusable workflow skills.

It is designed to work both in Red Hat-centric environments and as a standalone personal or open-source toolkit. Runtime paths, credentials, service sockets, and repository locations are configurable rather than hard-coded.

## What's Inside

### Core Infrastructure
- **Memory Service** — Optional central authority for concurrent session access
- **Thompson Router** — Intelligent model selection based on learned performance
- **Autonomous Learning** — Self-improvement from real task outcomes
- **Arbitration Orchestrator** — Multi-phase worker/arbiter pattern for critical decisions
- **Graph Service** — Loopback-only durable Graph HTTP service managed by systemd

### Optimization & Analysis
- **GA Tuning** — Genetic algorithm optimization every 4 hours (synthetic, zero cost)
- **Model Discovery** — Probes Anthropic/Google/Cursor APIs every 4 hours for latest models
- **Cost Tracking** — JSONL audit log of all API usage
- **5 Dashboards** — Cost, Thompson routing, autonomous learning, GA tuning, performance

### Workflow Skills (Learning-Integrated)
- **Code PR Review** (`code-pr-review`) — AI consensus code review, Thompson-routed model selection
- **Documentation** (`code-doc`) — Auto-generate docs, learns which models write better
- **Release Notes** (`code-release-notes`) — Generate from commits with multi-AI consensus
- **Autonomous Variants** (`code-pr-review-auto`, `code-doc-auto`) — Run without user confirmation

All skills feed outcomes into Thompson — models learn task-specific performance over time.

### Capabilities  
- **Compression** — 64.6% token reduction via recursive text compression
- **Caching** — Prompt caching framework with hit/miss tracking (Phase 1 ready)
- **Hooks** — Memory search on prompt submit, learning extraction
- **Memory** — Project memory files (feedback, projects, references)

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlossWare/claude-ensemble/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create symlinks in `~/.claude/`
3. Set up credentials storage at `~/.FlossWare/secrets.env`
4. Prompt you to configure which tools to enable

**See [CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md](CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md)** for how to configure API tokens and credentials (auto-loaded in all sessions).

### Session Initialization
On startup, `scripts/ensemble-init.sh` automatically:
1. Connects to memory service (systemd daemon)
2. Initializes autonomous learning
3. Discovers latest models (Claude 5, Gemini, Cursor)
4. Prints toolkit status

```bash
✓ Connected to memory service
✓ Autonomous learner ready
✓ Claude Ensemble Toolkit initialized
  Tools: compression, caching, cost_tracking, ga_tuning, thompson_router, arbitration
  Memory: ~/.claude/projects/memory
  Arbitration: multi-phase orchestrator for critical decisions
  Autonomous learning: Thompson continuously improving from real tasks
```

### Run Dashboards
After doing real work, view your performance:

```bash
cost-dashboard.py              # Spending by model/provider/workflow/day
thompson-dashboard.py          # Routing accuracy, model rankings, quality
autonomous-learning-dashboard.py  # Learning progress, outcomes
ga-tuning-dashboard.py         # Fitness trends, parameter evolution
```

### Workflow Skills
For routine tasks with learning integration:

```bash
# Interactive PR review (asks before approve/reject)
/code-pr-review

# Autonomous PR review (auto-approves/rejects)
/code-pr-review-auto

# Interactive documentation generation
/code-doc

# Autonomous doc generation
/code-doc-auto

# Generate release notes from commits
/code-release-notes
```

See **[SKILL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](SKILL_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)** for full details on how skills learn and route models via Thompson.

### Multi-Phase Arbitration
For critical decisions (security, breaking changes, complex bugs):

```bash
arbitrate code-review /path/to/repo --phases 3 --context-dir src/api
arbitrate bug-analysis error.log code.py --phases 2
arbitrate security-audit src/ --phases 3
```

Each stage runs multiple independent workers followed by an arbiter. The arbiter adjudicates the worker results, and the complete execution/review state is handed to the next configured stage. Model labels may be reused across stages.

## Canonical REST Integration

Claude Ensemble has one client-facing REST boundary at `127.0.0.1:8080` by default:

- `/api/v1/graph/*` routes to the independently managed Graph REST service.
- `/api/v1/memory/*` routes to the independently managed Memory REST service.
- `/api/v1/decision/*` exposes Decision Support through the same public boundary.
- Other services may be registered with `ENSEMBLE_<SERVICE>_URL` without changing the public contract.

Services may run independently, but service integration uses REST/HTTP contracts rather than implementation imports or shared storage. The gateway does not supervise service lifecycles. Remote forwarding/federation remains a separate concern.

## Architecture

### Graph Service (Systemd Daemon)
- **Path:** `graph-service/`
- **Status:** Independently managed by the systemd user service `claude-graph.service`
- **Endpoint:** `127.0.0.1:8766`
- **Storage:** `~/.local/share/claude-ensemble/graph.json` by default
- **Function:** Durable Graph REST boundary; it does not supervise sibling services

### Memory Service (Optional Systemd Daemon)
- **Path:** `memory-service/`
- **Status:** Running (auto-start on login)
- **Port:** Per-user Unix socket under the configured Claude Ensemble runtime directory
- **Function:** Thread-safe access to shared memory across concurrent sessions

### Thompson Router
- **Path:** `shared/thompson_router.py`
- **Models:** Haiku (cheap), Sonnet (balanced), Opus (capable), Cursor, Gemini
- **Algorithm:** Bayesian inference with Beta distributions
- **Cost Savings:** 67% vs Opus-for-all (tested)

### Autonomous Learning
- **Path:** `learning/autonomous_learning.py`, `tools/autonomous-learner.py`
- **Workers:** 4 independent models capture outcomes, score, update priors, tune capability matrix
- **Trigger:** After every real task (online learning)
- **Storage:** `learning/autonomous_outcomes/`, `learning/autonomous_priors/`

### Arbitration Orchestrator
- **Path:** `arbitration/`
- **Guarantees:** 
  - No model is both arbiter and worker in same run
  - Each stage runs multiple independent workers followed by one arbiter
  - Workers and the arbiter are isolated within each stage
  - Each later stage receives complete prior-stage execution/review state
  - Stage count is configuration-driven; confidence does not terminate the pipeline
- **Context Access:** Git diffs, full files, dependencies, module context

### GA Tuning
- **Path:** `ga_tuning/`
- **Frequency:** Every 4 hours (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 UTC)
- **Evaluators:** 5 independent (compression, Thompson, caching, capability matrix, learning rate)
- **Cost:** Zero (synthetic tasks, no API calls)
- **Parameters:** Tuned automatically, logged to `ga_tuning/parameter_evolution.md`

### Model Discovery
- **Path:** `tools/discover-models.py`
- **Frequency:** Every 4 hours (synced with GA tuning)
- **Providers:** Anthropic (free API call), Google (free API call), Cursor (defaults to latest)
- **Updates:** Thompson router inline, settings.json with discovery timestamp

## Portable / Standalone Mode

Claude Ensemble does not require the Red Hat workstation layout. Runtime paths can be
configured with environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ENSEMBLE_ROOT` | Repository root used by shell initialization | Repository containing `scripts/ensemble-init.sh` |
| `ENSEMBLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | Optional credentials file | `~/.FlossWare/secrets.env` |
| `ENSEMBLE_MEMORY_DIR` | Persistent memory directory | `~/.claude/projects/memory` |
| `ENSEMBLE_LOG_DIR` | Service log directory | `~/.claude` |
| `ENSEMBLE_RUNTIME_DIR` | Runtime directory for configurable service sockets | XDG runtime/cache location |
| `ENSEMBLE_REPO_ROOT` | Repository inspected by alerting | Current working directory |
| `ENSEMBLE_LEARNING_DIR` | Learning state directory | Existing Claude Ensemble learning path |
| `ENSEMBLE_ALERT_DIR` | Alert state directory | `~/.claude/alerts` |
| `ENSEMBLE_*_SOCKET` | Per-service Unix socket override | Existing service socket |

For a standalone installation, services are optional. The memory client already degrades
gracefully when its daemon is unavailable, and the learning/Thompson/alert services can
be run only when their corresponding features are needed. No Red Hat GitLab host,
credential file, or repository path is required by the core runtime.

Example:

```bash
export ENSEMBLE_ROOT="$HOME/src/claude-ensemble"
export ENSEMBLE_MEMORY_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/claude-ensemble/memory"
export ENSEMBLE_LOG_DIR="$HOME/.local/state/claude-ensemble"
export ENSEMBLE_REPO_ROOT="$HOME/src/my-project"
```

On systems without systemd, use the CLI tools and standalone components directly rather
than installing the optional user services.

## Configuration

**Settings:** `settings.json.default` (copy to `~/.claude/settings.json` to customize)

**Credentials:** `~/.FlossWare/secrets.env` or environment variables
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- GOOGLE_API_KEY
- CURSOR_API_KEY
- Custom keys for any MCP servers you configure

**MCP Servers:** `~/.mcp.json` (configure as needed)

## Cost Optimization Stack

Three complementary techniques:

1. **Thompson Router** (67% savings) — Route to cheapest capable model
2. **Compression** (64.6% reduction) — Token reduction via text compression
3. **Caching** (69.8% savings) — Reuse frequent prompts

**Combined:** Can exceed 90% savings on token-heavy workflows.

## Future Work

See GitHub issues:
- Arbiter explanations + teaching signals (tabled, needs neural-ai research)
- Consolidate cost tracking dashboards
