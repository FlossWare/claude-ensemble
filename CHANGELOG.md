# Changelog

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-05

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed 4 security vulnerabilities in `code-solve.js` createIssueClaimer function
  - **RCE Fix #1**: Shell injection on issueId - now validates as positive integer (1-999999999)
  - **RCE Fix #2**: Shell injection on label parameter - now validates alphanumeric + dash/underscore only
  - **Fix #3**: Missing validation - throws clear error if item.id/item.number missing
  - **Fix #4**: Race condition improvements - better variable quoting, JSON parsing with jq
  - Impact: Prevents remote code execution if attacker controls issue IDs or label values
  - Registration preserved: Meta block remains at line 4, workflow still appears in skills list

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- **code-solve.js**: Moved `export const meta` block to top of file (line 4) for proper workflow registration
  - Meta block must be FIRST statement (after comments) for harness to discover workflow
  - Previously at line 148, preventing skill registration
  - Now appears in available skills list as `/code-solve`
- **code-solve.md**: Added YAML frontmatter for skill discovery

### Documentation
- Updated memory: claude-code-workflows.md with root cause of registration failure
- Documented requirement: `export const meta` must be first statement in workflow files
