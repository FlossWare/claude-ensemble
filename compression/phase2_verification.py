Phase 2 CREATE VERIFICATION - Prompt Compression Production Validation

Verify Phase 1 compressor (41.2% token reduction) works reliably in production.

4 Challenger Tests:
1. CHALLENGER 1 (Sonnet) - Real workflow testing on 10 actual RH Disseminator prompts
2. CHALLENGER 2 (Opus 4.8) - Edge cases: empty, short, long (10K+), code-heavy, domain terms
3. CHALLENGER 3 (Gemini) - Semantic preservation check on 5 critical RH tasks
4. CHALLENGER 4 (Haiku) - Integration with Thompson router + caching

Final Verdict: Production-ready?

    """
    CPSEARCH-10981 involves implementing keyset pagination for Solr queries.
    The issue is that the current AND logic fails when cursors span logical boundaries.
    Previous work in commits a840f115 and b7edae1d fixed critical blocker issues from code review.
    The new method signature was updated across 8 concrete component unit tests.
    All 9 concrete implementations were updated with the new method signature.
    The processor test assertion used incorrect Solr bracket syntax which was fixed.
    Test mismatches and logging from code review were also corrected.
    The issue impacts keyset pagination with AND vs OR logic, similar to cursorMark alternative.
    Frontend integration pending after backend validation completes.

    # 2. Multi-AI Consensus Workflow
    """
    Multi-AI consensus uses a fleet-based approach with 3-8 models.
    Models include Opus, Sonnet, DeepSeek-Chat, Qwen3-Coder, fable, Hermes-405B,
    Nemotron-Ultra-550B, and others. Phase 1 uses the arbiter-worker pattern.
    Panel 1: opus, sonnet, DeepSeek-Chat, Qwen3-Coder with Opus arbiter.
    Panel 2: fable, Hermes-405B, Nemotron-Ultra-550B, Qwen3-Next-80B with Sonnet arbiter.
    Zero overlap between panels prevents confirmation bias. Non-Claude models
    accessed via OpenRouter fleet API for true independence. Examples include
    code review workflows (find issues), meta-review (challenge findings),
    fix proposals (multiple options), and verification (confirm no new bugs).
    The 4-phase cycle runs: review → meta-review → fix → verify. Performance
    metrics: 3 workers in 2-4s using 2K-5K tokens, 6 workers in 3-6s using 5K-10K tokens,
    8 workers in 15-30s using 20K-40K tokens.

    """
    Disseminator deployment modes include starting_at_qa and only_qa behavior.
    The deployment spreadsheet tracks every deploy by date, release, version, and environment.
    Release notes are bi-weekly in R-release format with hyperlinks and Jira integration.
    Team timezones: EST (csanders, loleary, grgardne), IST (ypant, rghandi, vmhaskar).
    Deployment gating appears after each stage completes, not during execution.
    Manual gates are required before stage transitions. SSH to aio-01 is needed
    when working offsite (not on 192.168.1.x/24 network). Disseminator is part of
    the CPSEARCH project with AWX connectivity issues due to NetworkPolicy blocking
    GitLab pods from AAP. The integration with UXE Search requires AP-ADR0003
    integration architecture diagrams in XE Compass.

    """
    The FlossWare/model-router is a decorator-based LLM routing system for the $300/month budget.
    It supports Anthropic (Claude: Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), Google Gemini, and JetBrains Cursor.
    RH approved models only via official non-personal API keys. Default model is Haiku 4.5
    (cheapest capable), escalating to Sonnet for complex work (code review, architecture,
    feature design) and Opus for critical bugs (security, logic flaws, breaking changes).
    Multi-AI consensus required for critical work: Sonnet 4.5 initial review, Opus 5
    adversarial challenge, then user arbitration. Cost optimization targets 20-30% token
    reduction via summarization, deduplication, context windowing, and query optimization.
    Thompson Sampling bandit learns which routing strategies work best. Safe pairings include
    Sonnet + Opus (different reasoning), Sonnet + Opus 4.8 (forces external challenge),
    Opus 5 + Gemini (completely different). Avoid: Opus 5 + Opus 4.8 (too similar),
    same model reviewing itself (circular).
